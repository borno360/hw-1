    <p>
        Enacted August 6, 2015, the Notice of Observation Treatment and Implication for Care Eligibility Act (NOTICE Act) requires hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) 
        <p>to provide notification to individuals receiving observation services as outpatients for more than 24 hours explaining the status of the individual as an outpatient, not an inpatient, and the implications of such status.</p> 
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>
            Hospitals and CAHs are required to furnish a new CMS-developed standardized notice, the Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice <b>(MOON)</b>, to a Medicare beneficiary who has been receiving observation services as an outpatient. Under CMS’ final NOTICE Act regulation, published August 2, 2016, hospitals and CAHs may deliver the MOON to individuals receiving observation services as an outpatient before such individuals have received more than 24 hours of observation services. The notice must be provided no later than 36 hours after observation services are initiated or, if sooner, upon release;
        </li>

    <p>
        <li>
           <b> The MOON</b> will inform more than one million beneficiaries annually of the reason(s) they are an outpatient receiving observation services and the implications of such status with regard to Medicare cost sharing and coverage for post-hospitalization skilled nursing facility (SNF) services; and 
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <li>
            An oral explanation of <b>the MOON</b> must be provided, ideally in conjunction with the delivery of the notice, and a signature must be obtained from the individual, or a person acting on such individual’s behalf, to acknowledge receipt. In cases where such individual or person refuses to sign the MOON, the staff member of the hospital or CAH providing the notice must sign the notice to certify that notification was presented.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>The standardized notice, <b>the MOON</b>, has gone through the Paperwork Reduction Act process, thus affording the public an opportunity to comment on <b>the MOON</b>.</p>

The documents obtained by Vice, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), similar to Right to Information in <i><b>India</b></i>, include scientific research, contracts, presentations, briefings, and memos related to the program along with documents written for or by former Senator Harry Reid, who, according to Vice, was responsible for the creation of the program.

        The 1600-page document shows the extent of research underway in AATIP, which was a secretive organisation that came into the public domain after its former director resigned from the Pentagon. The agency was funded by the US Defense Intelligence Agency and has been at the center of several theories over the existence of <strong>Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs)</strong>.
